✅ MASTER PROMPT FOR REPLIT

(Society Visitor Entry Management System – Full-Stack Web App)

You are an expert full-stack engineer and system architect.
Build a production-style, internship-level, full-stack web application based on the detailed requirements below.
This is not a demo and not a toy CRUD app — it must reflect real-world logic, clean architecture, and live data flow.

📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW

Build a Society Visitor Entry Management Web Application that replaces traditional paper-based visitor registers used in residential societies.

The system must:

Digitize visitor entry using QR-based access

Enforce resident approval before entry

Provide role-based dashboards

Store all data in a real database

Reflect live status updates across users

The application must be web-first and mobile-friendly, so visitors can use it directly from their phone browser without installing an app.

🎯 CORE PROBLEM THIS PROJECT SOLVES

Current society systems:

Use paper registers

Have no real verification

Are messy and insecure

Have no transparency or analytics

This system must:

Prevent unauthorized entry

Give residents full control

Make guards act only as verifiers

Give admins visibility into all activity

👥 USER ROLES & PERMISSIONS (VERY IMPORTANT)
1️⃣ Visitor (Public User – No Login)

Access only via QR code

Can:

Submit a visitor entry request

View approval/rejection status in real time

Cannot:

Modify data after submission

View internal society data

2️⃣ Resident (Authenticated User)

Linked to one flat

Can:

View visitor requests for their flat

Approve or reject requests

Cannot:

See other flats’ visitors

Access admin or guard controls

3️⃣ Security Guard (Authenticated User)

Can:

View live visitor requests

Verify approval status

Cannot:

Approve or reject requests

Modify visitor data

4️⃣ Chairman / Admin (Super User)

One-time setup authority

Can:

Create society, blocks, flats

Add residents and guards

View all visitor logs

Monitor statistics and activity

Cannot:

Override resident approval logic

🔄 SYSTEM FLOW (MUST MATCH EXACTLY)
🔹 One-Time Setup (Admin)

Admin logs in

Creates:

Society profile

Blocks and flats

Registers residents (mapped to flats)

Registers guards

Generates society QR code

QR code URL points to visitor request page

🔹 Daily Visitor Entry Flow

Visitor arrives at gate

Scans QR code

Visitor form opens (no login)

Visitor enters:

Name

Phone number

Flat number

Purpose of visit

Optional vehicle number

Visitor submits request
→ Status = PENDING

Resident logs in

Resident sees request

Resident approves or rejects

Guard dashboard updates live

Visitor shows confirmation screen

Entry allowed only if approved

All actions must be logged.

🗄 DATA MODELS (CONCEPTUAL)

Design clean relational models for:

User (with roles)

Society

Block

Flat

VisitorRequest

VisitorRequest must include:

Visitor name

Phone number

Flat reference

Purpose

Status (Pending / Approved / Rejected)

Timestamp

🧠 LOGIC & BEHAVIOR REQUIREMENTS

Role-based access control

Public access only for visitor form

Live status reflection across dashboards

No hardcoded data

No fake approvals

No shared permissions

🎨 UI / UX REQUIREMENTS

Clean, modern, professional UI

Mobile-responsive design

Clear status indicators:

Pending (yellow)

Approved (green)

Rejected (red)

Simple, intuitive forms

Dashboards designed for:

Quick decision (resident)

Fast verification (guard)

🧰 TECHNOLOGY STACK (MANDATORY)
Frontend

React

Tailwind CSS

Axios for API calls

Backend

Django

Django REST Framework

JWT or session authentication

Database

PostgreSQL

Architecture

Frontend and backend separated

REST APIs

Environment-based configuration

🚀 DEPLOYMENT EXPECTATION

App must be deployable on free cloud platforms

Use environment variables

Database must persist data

URLs must be public and testable

🧱 DEVELOPMENT APPROACH (STEP-BY-STEP)

Build the project in this order:

Backend models and database schema

Authentication and user roles

Visitor request APIs

Resident approval logic

Guard verification APIs

Frontend visitor flow

Frontend dashboards

Live data updates

UI/UX polish

Deployment readiness

🎓 PROJECT GOAL

This project is built to:

Solve a real-world problem

Demonstrate full-stack engineering skills

Be resume-worthy

Be explainable in interviews

Reflect real production thinking

Avoid shortcuts, mock data, or oversimplifications.

✅ OUTPUT EXPECTATION FROM YOU (REPLIT)

Fully working full-stack project

Clean folder structure

Meaningful variable and function names

Scalable architecture

Best practices followed

Code that a student can learn from
